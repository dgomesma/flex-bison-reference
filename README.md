# flex-bison-reference
In construction reference and tutorial on Flex and Bison for parsing motivated by the [rinha-de-compiler](https://github.com/dgomesma/rinha-de-compiler).

# Future Plans
- Finish explanation for Bison.
- Include code examples for both Bison and Flex.
- Review for correctness.

# Currently On Pause
Since I am also a participant in the [rinha-de-compiler](https://github.com/dgomesma/rinha-de-compiler) and, so far
I have spent more time studying and writing this tutorial then actually writing the compiler itself, I will pause
this tutorial for now and will resume it as soon as I deliver something to the rinha.

If someone becomes interested in this tutorial and would like to complete it with material while I am away,
please do feel free to make a PR to this project and I will take a look at it.
